# Fixes Applied to WASM Extension System

## Date: 2025-09-30

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes applied to address issues identified in the code review of the WASM extension system.

## Critical Fixes

### 1. ✅ Removed Hardcoded Extension Fields
**Issue:** `schema.rs` contained hardcoded extension field methods (getAllIssues, getIssue, createIssue, updateIssue) despite having a dynamic ExtensionFieldRegistry system.

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed all hardcoded extension query methods from QueryRoot
- Removed all hardcoded extension mutation methods from MutationRoot
- Removed unused JSON scalar type that was only used for extension fields
- Extension fields now resolved dynamically via ExtensionFieldRegistry

**Files Modified:**
- `server/src/graphql/schema.rs` - Removed ~70 lines of hardcoded extension code

**Impact:** Schema is now truly dynamic. Extensions can add fields without modifying core schema code.

### 2. ✅ Improved Blocking Runtime Handling
**Issue:** Used `tokio::runtime::Handle::current().block_on()` without error handling, which could panic if no runtime exists.

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed to `tokio::runtime::Handle::try_current()` with proper error handling
- Added comprehensive error logging for database operations
- Added documentation explaining the sync/async trade-off
- Improved error messages returned to extensions

**Files Modified:**
- `server/src/extensions/wit_bindings.rs` - Updated query(), execute(), and migrate() functions

**Impact:** Better error handling and clearer documentation of the sync WASM binding limitations.

### 3. ✅ Fixed Database Query Result Format
**Issue:** WIT interface returned flat `list<record-value>` which lost row boundaries, making it impossible for extensions to distinguish between rows.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `query-row` record type to WIT interface
- Changed `query-result` to return `list<query-row>` instead of flat list
- Updated implementation to properly construct QueryRow structures
- Each row now maintains its column values as a distinct list

**Files Modified:**
- `server/wit/extension.wit` - Added QueryRow record, updated QueryResult variant
- `server/src/extensions/wit_bindings.rs` - Updated query() to return proper row structure

**Impact:** Extensions can now properly parse query results with multiple rows and columns.

### 4. ✅ Cleaned Up Incomplete Federation Implementation
**Issue:** `federation_coordinator.rs` had hardcoded checks and incomplete query planning implementation.

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed hardcoded "getAllIssues" string check
- Replaced incomplete query planning with clear TODO and explanation
- Added documentation explaining this is experimental and not the main approach
- Made it clear that `build_schema()` should be used instead of `create_federated_schema()`

**Files Modified:**
- `server/src/graphql/federation_coordinator.rs` - Simplified and documented limitations

**Impact:** Code is honest about current capabilities. No misleading implementations.

## Documentation Updates

### 5. ✅ Updated Status Documents
**Fix Applied:**
- Updated REVIEW_FIXES.md to reflect actual WIT path configuration
- Updated to note that hardcoded extension fields have been removed
- Created this FIXES_APPLIED.md document

**Files Modified:**
- `server/REVIEW_FIXES.md` - Corrected inaccuracies
- `server/FIXES_APPLIED.md` - Created new summary document

## Testing Requirements

### Extension WASM Rebuild Required
**Action Needed:** The extension WASM file needs to be rebuilt due to WIT interface changes:

```bash
# In nix environment
cd server/extensions/example-rust-extension
cargo build --target wasm32-wasip1 --release

# Convert to component (if wasm-tools available)
wasm-tools component new \
    target/wasm32-wasip1/release/forgepoint_extension_issues.wasm \
    -o ../../extensions_dir/issues.wasm
```

### Compilation Testing
The server should now compile cleanly in the Nix development environment:

```bash
nix develop --impure
cd server
cargo check
cargo test
```

## Summary

**Files Changed:** 5
**Lines Added:** ~60
**Lines Removed:** ~120
**Net Change:** -60 lines (code simplified)

**Status:**
- ✅ Hardcoded fields removed
- ✅ Runtime handling improved
- ✅ WIT interface fixed
- ✅ Federation documented as incomplete
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ⏳ Compilation testing pending (requires Nix environment)

## Next Steps

1. Enter Nix development environment
2. Rebuild extension WASM with updated WIT interface
3. Run `cargo check` to verify compilation
4. Run `cargo test` to verify existing tests pass
5. Test extension loading and field resolution
6. Verify query results return proper row structures
